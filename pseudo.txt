- firebase project
- data will be stored in firebase as an object
  - this object will contain stats information as each key (points, drops, assists, blocks, turnovers, etc.)
  - ideally Firebase will store things like this:


  [
    {
      player: 'Vanna Chan',
      games: [
                {
                  title: "Game1"
                  stats: {
                    points: 1,
                    drops: 0,
                    assists: 3,
                    blocks: 1,
                    completions: 10,
                    ...
                  }
                }, {
                  title: "Floppy vs Ricerbergs"
                  stats: {
                    points: 2,
                    drops: 3,
                    assists: 0,
                    blocks: 0,
                    completions: 8,
                    ...
                  }
                }
              ]
    } , {
        player: 'John Doe',
        games: [
                  {
                    title: "Game1"
                    stats: {
                      points: 1,
                      drops: 0,
                      assists: 3,
                      blocks: 1,
                      completions: 10,
                      ...
                    }
                  }
                ]
    }
  ]

- Each key will be populated onto the page with a '+' and '-' button on either side
- firebase will:
  - watch these buttons
  - update the database
  - re-render the page based on that
  - this update will also update the summary section of the page


Good to know:
